===== Overview =====

CSVtoHTML is a software designed to be deployed on a Linux server. It requires python and php as well as apache to run correctly. The software was designed to take a .csv file and convert it to a web page. The csv file includes dates and times in order to allow you to show different content during different times of the day. The system is hard coded to a limit of 4 periods during the day. The main usage of the system is for lunch menus.
